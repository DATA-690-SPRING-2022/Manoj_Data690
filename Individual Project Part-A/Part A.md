#  Access to Electricity
#### Around 13% of the world does not have access to electricity. For poverty reduction, economic growth, and standard of living improvements, electricity is essential. Measuring the percentage of people who have access to electricity is thus an important social and economic indicator. There is no universally accepted definition of what it means to have access to electricity. The majority of definitions, on the other hand, are focused on the provision of electricity, safe cooking facilities, and a required minimum level of consumption. 

#### The International Energy Agency's (IEA) definition encompasses more than just household delivery. It also requires households to meet a minimum level of electricity, which varies depending on whether the household is rural or urban and rises over time. This minimum threshold is 250 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year for rural households and 500 kWh per year for urban households.

# Outlook
![](newplot.png)
#### In this bar graph we can observe that the access of electricity for the three countries and out of three countries India has low access of electricity in rural areas. Although the population in India and China varies less compared with U.S.A but by observing the trend India is lacking in access of electricity more.

#### In this pie chart the access of electricity for urban regions of three countries and the trend is similar here.
